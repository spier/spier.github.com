This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for [spier.github.com](http://spier.github.com). 

So far this fork of [Zach Holman's blog](http://zachholman.com) follows the original fairly closely, with some minor modifications. I might change this one day if I find the time.
