These are some of my pet projects that I have been working on in my spare time. The purpose of most of them was to explore new technologies and learn new things. Some of them might not be online anymore at the time of viewing this page.

This application was developed during the <a href="http://dev.springer.com">Springer API Challenge</a> in 2011. It was a great learning experience in terms of working with heroku, ruby, and the Springer API.

			Springer Quotes let's you search more than 80 thousand articles from Springer's open access journals. When you find a particularly interesting article you can create quotes from paragraphs or individual sentences. These quotes can be used to point fellow resources to specific sections of articles or to reference these quotes within your own scientific work.

			</p>
			I developed briefling.de together with my friend <a href="http://pixelmove.de/">Pascal</a>. briefling.de makes it very easy to create professionally layouted letters in PDF format. They can be directly created on the website be filling out the required data in the forms. The PDFs can then be stored locally. In the future we might extent the functionality to enable the posting of letters directly from our service.

			</p>
			I developed FANtasy Rotation with my good friend Helge back in 2006 and we have been maintaining it ever since. It is a game for the German basketball club <a href="http://www.albaberlin.de">Alba Berlin</a>, which allows to users to make bets on how much playing time each individual player will get for the upcoming games. The site also has a vast collection of statistics and news reaching back to 2005, which is actually even more popular than the game itself :-)

				Kneipenguide
			</p>
			In 2003 I architected and implemented a Content Management System for one of the then early location services in the German market called kneipenguide.de, again with my friend Helge. "kneipe" means pub in German, and kneipenguide.de made it easy for people to explore the best places for drinks and food in their city. On of the most favoured tools was the Happy Hour Finder, that helped the users to find an affordable way through their party night.

# Code

I might list some more prominent code repositories here in the future, but for the time being please refer to my [github space](https://github.com/spier) for some of the code that I have open-sourced.
