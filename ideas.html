    <h1>Ideas</h1>

    <p>
			We all have ideas, all the time. Most of them pass and for most of them it is good that way.
			Some others stick around for a bit longer. 
			
			Here I am collecting my ideas that I consider worthwhile pursuing and sharing. 
			Please let me know if either you want to support me in implementing this idea or if this already exists.
			
			So what I want to say: Please make sure that I don't do anything stupid!
