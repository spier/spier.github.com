title: "Why Start from Scratch?"
---

Seriously! Why would I want to start a new blog? 
After all I already one one at [blog.airness.de][airness]. So why start from scratch?

In short: I need a place where I can easily dump ideas and where people that are interested
in stuff like that can find it.

If you are interested in the long story, read on ...

# Prior Blogging

For my prior blog at [blog.airness.de][airness] I used [wordpress][wordpress]. That worked well for me for quite a while. I even ventured a bit deeper by writing some small [plugins][ebay-sales-lister] for it. Just eventually my blog became bloated with too many sidebars and thereby also quite slow. Worst of all, everything distracts from the main thing, which is the content.

I also ended up with two handful of drafts piling up that I never finished. Of course I mainly have to blame that on myself for being lazy but I also felt that in parts the process of posting and writing was too clumsy for me.

Then I ventured into [drupal][drupal] for a longer while. I really loved it at still do. At some point I will for sure use it for a bigger project but for what I want to do here, drupal has just too much power. It's like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut, just toooooo much.

# Geek? Geek!

I am a geek by heart. Took me a while to admit that but I guess it had to be said :) I love technology and trying out new stuff. So why not try [jekyll][jekyll]? 

It is plain, clean and easy. I write my posts in plain text files (that I use for all kinds of stuff anyways), and I can use [markdown syntax][markdown] for the formatting! **Nice!** 

To top things, I can host the whole thing at [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), pushing new post via git. **Even nicer!**

# Almost Like a Longer Tweet

I find myself using twitter fairly frequently lately. It is quite a useful tool for a bunch of different purposes but I have to agree with [Dave Winer][davewiner] when it comes to the arbitrary 140 character: It is useless. Sometimes you just need to say a little bit more :)

So for all things that just break the 140 characters by a bit, I will be using this blog as well, and then point people to my posts if I consider them relevant enough.

# Idea Curation

We all have ideas, all the time. Most of them pass and for most of them it is good that way. Some others stick around for a bit longer. 

Now I will finally have a place where I can collect them to get input from others wrt their usefulness and support in implementing them.

# Inspiration

This blog is a fork of [Zach Holdman's Blog](http://zachholman.com/). As you see I even kept his design because I am too lazy to change things and I just want something to get started. If you should ever find this Zach, bare with me. It's open source after all, right? :)

I also kind of like the idea of the [timeless repository](http://timelessrepo.com/). Maybe I will morph jekyll into behaving like that one day, who knows.

For now, this is just a start. I will see where this leads.
