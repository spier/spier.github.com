I did it again. ;) After [speaking](https://spier.hu/2020/09/presenting-at-the-innersource-commons-2020-fall-summit) at the previous InnerSource Commons Summit already, this time around I joined forces with fellow InnerSourcerer Fei Wan from Comcast to present at the [ISC APAC 2020 Summit](https://eventyay.com/e/3dbaaa50).

Together where shared how our InnerSource adoption benefitted from Patterns and how we started contributing to the InnerSource Patterns working group. 

Our talk coincided with the release of the [InnerSource Patterns book](https://innersourcecommons.gitbook.io/innersource-patterns), which we hope will make it easier for the community to consume the InnerSource Patterns  and learn from them. 

You find both video and slides of the presentation below.
