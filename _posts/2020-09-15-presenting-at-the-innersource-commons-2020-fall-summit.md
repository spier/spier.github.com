Since late 2019 I am a member of the [InnerSource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org), a community of people passionate about fostering the adoption of **InnerSource**: the use of Open Source best practices for software development within the confines of an organization .

When I heard that they were organizing an Online Summit, I decided to throw my hat in the ring and try to get involved as a presenter. This was also motived by my experience at [FOSS Backstage](/2020/04/biases-busted-at-foss-backstage-2020) earlier in the year, which I had thoroughly enjoyed.

## 1 year in the InnerSource Commons Community: Getting your money's worth

I got lucky, as my talk proposal got accepted. The topic of my talk was aiming at people like me that were new to a community like this, and didn't know how to get the most out of their involvement.

Or in the words of my talk abstract:

> Let me make the argument for you: Convince yourself (and your manager) of the benefits of participating in the InnerSource Commons community.

I prepared my slides and the recording for the talk, which got screened at the [InnerSource Commons 2020 Fall Summit](https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-fall-2020-agenda/) on September 15th.

Presenting at this conference was a great experience, as I got to practice my presentation skills and it allowed me to get involved even more actively in this fantastic community.

You find both video and slides of my presentation below.
