I developed FANtasy Rotation with my good friend Helge back in 2006 and we have been maintaining it ever since. It is a game for the German basketball club [Alba Berlin](http://www.albaberlin.de), which allows to users to make bets on how much playing time each individual player will get for the upcoming games. The site also has a vast collection of statistics and news reaching back to 2005, which eventually turned out to be more popular than the game itself.
