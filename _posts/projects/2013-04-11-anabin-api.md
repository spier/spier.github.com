The [University Database anabin][anabin] did not have an API, so I wrote a simple one to demonstrate what cool integrations could be built, if there only was an API. Uses [grape][] for the API, [swagger-ui][] for documentation, and [heroku][] for hosting.

[swagger-ui]: https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui
