In 2003 I architected and implemented a Content Management System for one of the then early location services in the German market called kneipenguide.de, again with my friend Helge. "kneipe" means pub in German, and kneipenguide.de made it easy for people to explore the best places for drinks and food in their city. On of the most favoured tools was the Happy Hour Finder, that helped the users to find an affordable way through their party night.
