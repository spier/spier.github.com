During the [Apps for Development](http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com/) contest of the World Bank I created this YQL datatables to make working with the World Bank Data API easier. The [sources](https://github.com/spier/yql_worldbank) are hosted at github and I also contributed them to the official [YQL Community Tables](http://www.datatables.org).
