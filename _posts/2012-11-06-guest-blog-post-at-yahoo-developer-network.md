I am very excited that Yahoo gave me the opportunity to write a guest blog post about YQL at the Yahoo Developer Network. The post I cam up with is called [YQL – The Swiss army knife of web services](http://yhoo.it/Viz91B).

Also check out the geeky graphic they came up with (Photo by by [Jinho.Jung](http://www.flickr.com/photos/phploveme/)).
