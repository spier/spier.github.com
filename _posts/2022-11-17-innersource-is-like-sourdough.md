I just gave a talk at the [InnerSource Summit 2022](https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-2022/), with the title "InnerSource is like Sourdough".

A recording will be published shortly, which I will share here.

## Summary

When baking bread with sourdough you are dealing with the sometimes surprizing behavior of wild yeasts, creating a bubbly dough that eventually turns into tasty bread.

Learning how to handle sourdough takes time, practices, and the willingness to experiment and fail. However once you master it, you are rewarded with more healthy bread, richer in flavor and with a longer shelf life!

[InnerSource](https://innersourcecommons.org/) has many similarities to sourdough in this regards.

This talk highlights those similarities in a both thought-provoking and fun way. And to make everybody hungry there will be a lot of bread pictures ;)
