title: "Writing for ProgrammableWeb"

Since January I am writing for [ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com/profile/spier) in my spare time.
Although my main area of experience is the Tech industry, I have always enjoyed writing, so publishing articles at ProgrammableWeb gives me the opportunity to expose the content I write to a much larger audience, and get into discussions with a lot of people about topics that I am very interested in.

The first two articles I wrote for ProgrammableWeb are:

* [How Many Newspapers Have an API?](http://bit.ly/wd6LWM)
* [German Press Release Service Offers API](http://bit.ly/wDFgY0)

On the flip side this also means that I will have less time to write articles on [spier.hu](http://spier.hu). Instead I will regularly link to my articles from here that get published on [ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com).

Really looking forward to this new experience!
