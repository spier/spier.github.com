# spier.hu (spier.github.io)

This is a [Jekyll][]-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages][] for [spier.github.io][] (redirected from [spier.hu][]).

This blog started from a fork of [Zach Holman's blog](http://zachholman.com) (thanks Zach, all the power to open source). I have kept the design of the blog pretty bare-bones, to focus on the content.
