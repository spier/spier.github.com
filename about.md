![Sebastian Spier](/images/sebastian/sebastian_spier_multi.png "Sebastian Spier")

I am a 30-something German, with a passion for people, coding, open source development, basketball, and last but not least excellent [cake and coffee][]. 

I am working in the lovely city of [Berlin][] where I am leading a development team for SaaS company [Meltwater][meltwater]. Previously I have worked in Hungary and Ghana as well but eventually it pulled me back to my home country.

This place on the web is quite obviously my own, so views expressed here are my own as well, and have nothing to do with my employer.

# Contact

The best way to contact me is [Twitter][]. You can also find my professional profiles at [Xing][] (German) and [Linkedin][] (English).
