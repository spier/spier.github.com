title: "About Sebastian Spier"
---

I am Sebastian. My passions are people, coding, open source development, basketball, and last but not least excellent [cake and coffee][].

The lovely city of [Berlin][] is what I call home. Previously I have lived and worked in Hungary, and Ghana. Eventually it always pulled me back to my home country.

spier.hu is my space on the web, so views expressed here are my own, and have nothing to do with my employer.

## Contact

The best way to contact me is [Twitter][].

You can also find my professional profile on [LinkedIn][].
