title: "About Sebastian Spier"
---

I am Sebastian. My passions are people, coding, open source development, basketball, and last but not least excellent [cake and coffee][].

The lovely city of [Berlin][] is what I call home, where I am leading an agile software development team for [Meltwater][]. Previously I have worked in Hungary and Ghana but eventually it always pulled me back to my home country.

spier.hu is my space on the web, so views expressed here are my own as well, and have nothing to do with my employer.

# Contact

The best way to contact me is [Twitter][]. You can also find my professional profiles at [LinkedIn][] (English) and [Xing][] (German).
